# SVM-using-libsvm-library
Implement a 5-fold cross validation interface with the libsvm code (do not use the one provided
by the libsvm library). Train the SVM with your code for values of Î³ : 0.25; 0:5; 1; 2; 4 and values
of C:5; 1; 2; 4; 8; 16 . Report the cross-validation error in a table with 30 entries. Pick the best
combination of and C. Train with all the data and report the training error and the test error over
the data in test.txt.
